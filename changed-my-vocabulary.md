# Books that changed my vocabulary

I've read quite a few non-fiction books over the years
that I thought were good,
and where I meant to do something as a result.
But then I don't.

But sometimes I read a book,
and some concept, or piece of terminology, immediately resonates.
Often it's crystallising out something I've already thought about,
perhaps only vaguely,
and becomes part of my vocabulary or mental model of the world.

I wondered if others have this experience too.
So I'm going to write up one example of my own,
and then ask some friends to chip in theirs.

## Purpose, Autonomy, and Mastery

In the book [Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us),
Daniel Pink says that people need three things to maintain motivation,
partiularly when thinking about their job:

 * **Purpose**: knowing that the thing you're working on has some value,
   whether to the bottom line of your company,
   for the good of humanity, etc.
   It's soul destroying to slog your guts out on something that gets
   binned before it sees the light of day.
   The point here is that is must have some worth *for you*.
 * **Autonomy**: if your team has a clear purpose, then everyone needs
   to own a little part of it.
   If you're working on something, but at any moment your manager might
   over-rule you, or hand it to someone else,
   then it's hard to care.
 * **Mastery**: are you being challenged to an appropriate level,
   learning skills and gaining experience that you feel are valuable?
   This doesn't have to mean you're under continuous change &mdash;
   you might be happy doing the same thing over and over,
   but gradually honing your performance on it.

If you've experienced burnout,
then I reckon at least one of those three wasn't satisfied.
Probably the hardest I've worked was at a startup,
but I never felt stressed, as those three bases were covered.
At other places, I can trace my negative feelings to one or more of PAM
not being satisfied.

## The Golden Path

It seems silly I admit,
but in [God Emperor of Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Emperor_of_Dune),
Frank Herbert pushed a concept I'll call adversarial evolution.
Without going into too much depth,
the book is about a character who becomes a tyrant,
with the sole purpose of training humanity out of societal habits that over emphasize safety and stability.

I don't see a "**Golden Path**" that would fix our many woes,
but many times I have considered problems that might be deserve such a method.

A stupid example would be passwords:
humans are bad at coming up with random strings of data
and they are worse at remembering them.
One solution to this problem would be forced evolution,
such that we all eventually have this capability.
We should just use access delegation to reduce how many passwords people have to remember though.

Another example is how people react to news these days:
opinions are galvanized before reading the first paragraph.
Our biases are being exploited and a (fictional) solution would be a Golden Path style intervention.

I don't actually believe a sweeping, general Golden Path would be the best way to resolve some of these issues,
but I do think it's an interesting thought experiment.
